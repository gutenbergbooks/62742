<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The life-story of Beethoven, contained
in these pages, is a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the events
of his childhood and youth, those of his
maturer years being merely indicated in
order to give symmetry to the narrative. It covers
just that period of his life in which young readers
are likely to be interested. Those who have the
leisure and inclination to study the details of his
entire career will find them in the biographies of
Schindler, Ries, Marx, Thayer, and others, but it
is questionable whether any of these will bring
the reader as closely to the actual man and musician
as this little story. And this is so not only
because it is a story, but because it is a story
true to life, with actual, not imaginary, personages,
set in a social, domestic, and musical environment
which is accurately reproduced, and dealing with
historical events which are correctly stated. In a
strict sense, therefore, it is not fiction, far less is it
rhapsody; and to this extent it is valuable not
alone for facts charmingly set forth, but for effects
which are realistic and which seem to bring the
actual Beethoven before the reader. It is the story
of a sad struggle against obstacles which sometimes
appeared almost insuperable; but its lesson for
youth is the reward of world-wide fame which followed
the exercise of industry, courage, honesty,
self-respect, and self-devotion to his calling. The
translator has endeavored to reproduce the story in
an English setting without sacrificing its charming
German characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><i>In Childhood</i></h2>
<p>December days are not usually considered
the most agreeable or most comfortable
days of the year, but no December day
could have been more disagreeable or uncomfortable
than the seventeenth of that month in
1774. A dense, almost impenetrable fog enveloped
that afternoon the city of Bonn on the Rhine, and
the country for miles around, in a cold, gray veil of
mist, through which hardly a ray of sunshine could
find its way. A fine rain, mingled with occasional
flakes of snow, drizzled through the fog and made
the pavements slippery and filthy. Everything one
looked upon, whether animate or inanimate, seemed
disagreeable. The sky was disagreeable. Disagreeably
the trees and shrubs in avenues and gardens
shook their leafless branches to free them from the
frozen raindrops which weighed them down. The
houses in the street were disagreeable, and their
usually attractive and brightly lighted windows
appeared that day most inhospitable. Disagreeably
and sullenly the rooks sat upon the roof-tops,
and the sparrows themselves, usually the sauciest
and jolliest companions among the feathered folk,
fluttered about anxiously, deserted each other, and
sought the warmest and driest little nooks in the
cornices, or near a warm chimney, without any concern
for the rest of the world. If two acquaintances
met on the street, the one greeted the other
with a woe-begone countenance. Everything seemed
depressed and disagreeable&mdash;the huckster women in
the market, the sentries at their posts, the few pedestrians
on the promenade, and the few faces which
appeared here and there at the darkened windows
and looked with lonesome gaze into the tedious,
gray, dense, cold fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>No person or object, however, appeared more irritable,
morose, and disagreeable than the court musician
and singer, Herr Johann van Beethoven,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> who
hurried through the unfriendly streets of Bonn, on
the third hour of that afternoon, frequently muttering
to himself imprecations and other exclamations
to relieve his feelings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;What weather!&rdquo; he growled, as he wrapped his
threadbare cloak around him more closely, when, in
turning a street corner, a sharp gust of wind smote
him fiercely. &ldquo;Everything goes wrong in these
ill-fated days. It is enough to drive one mad.
Two hours lost already this morning. Now I am
sent for again to make music because my lady is
not in good humor! Do these distinguished people
think that a musician of His Most Serene Highness,
Max Franz,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Elector of Cologne, is a bootblack?
I am tired of it all! And this weather, too!
Nothing but fog and rain, and not a kreuzer in
one&rsquo;s pocket! There may be those who can bear
such things patiently. I can&rsquo;t. Pah! The innkeeper
will trust me once more. I will go to him,
and better thoughts will come with something to
strengthen the heart and some lively company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muttering these words, he turned into a side street,
and after a few hundred paces entered a house, over
the door of which hung a green wreath, signifying
that wine was sold there. It was not until twilight
fell, and the streets, already darkened by the fog,
became doubly dark, that he came out. Another
person followed, escorting him with a light, evidently
so that he might not stumble upon the door-sill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Herr van Beethoven,&rdquo; this person
said. &ldquo;I must look after my own interests. I must
have the money in eight days, or credit stops. I
also am the father of a family, Herr van Beethoven,
and must take care of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make so many words, gossip,&rdquo; replied the
musician with some bitterness. &ldquo;I give you my
word of honor. You know me. Can you not act
generously with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The musician went on his way. The other, evidently
the keeper of the wine-shop, looked after him,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;He well
deserves better fortune. He is a pleasant, good-natured
companion, but certainly his position as a
member of the court chapel pays him but little,
and it costs money to feed a wife and two little
children. But he is past help. I cannot give him
credit longer than eight days at the most. He
already owes me too much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>While the wine-shop keeper was making these
reflections, his guest found his way with difficulty
through the dark streets. Had it been lighter, one
would have noticed by his actions that his craving
for a &ldquo;heart strengthener&rdquo; had in no way bettered
his condition. On the contrary, he appeared even
more sullen and morose than when he found it. His
brow was wrinkled. His lips, tightly closed by his
bitter feelings, opened only to utter imprecations and
words of discontent, as they had done a little while
before.</p>
<p>After walking around for about five minutes he
reached the Bonn Gasse. Here he lived in a small,
narrow, dark part of the &ldquo;Graus Haus.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> He entered
boisterously, and with great difficulty climbed
the dark, narrow staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Johann?&rdquo; asked a gentle voice on the
floor above, while at the same time a gleam of light
illumined the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; replied the musician sullenly. &ldquo;Have I
come home a little too early, Marie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never too early, and you are always welcome,
Johann,&rdquo; replied the first voice, with the same gentleness
as before. A pretty but somewhat faded woman
stepped forward and cordially gave her hand to her
husband to assist him up the last steps.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> &ldquo;What
is the matter, Johann? You seem so gloomy!
Think of it, this is the birthday of our little
Ludwig.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The husband was visibly surprised, and pressed
his hand to his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I should have forgotten it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added bitterly, &ldquo;how would it have
helped matters, anyway? I have not a kreuzer
with which to make the little one happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do not let that trouble you, dear husband,&rdquo;
replied his wife, smiling. &ldquo;Ludwig is happy enough,
and cares nothing for presents and the like. If you
would sing a little bit to him and play the piano a
little he would be perfectly contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he can have that much, and at least it
costs nothing,&rdquo; replied Johann Beethoven in a somewhat
more cheerful manner, as he returned the cordial
handshake of his wife. &ldquo;Yes, I will sing and
play, and thereby drive the bad spirit of discontent
out of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The two stepped into a small, narrow, meanly
furnished apartment, where they were welcomed with
a loud cry of joy by a little four-year-old boy, who
stretched out both his little hands to his mother.
He may have been somewhat timid in the dark
room, and the sight of his mother returning with the
light elicited from him the outcry. It had little
consolation for the father, however, for when the child
saw him he shrank back afraid, and hid his face in
the folds of his mother&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be polite, Ludwig, dear child,&rdquo; she said kindly
to him. &ldquo;It is your father. Give him a pat of
the hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy timidly stretched out his hand, but his
father did not take it. It was evident the child&rsquo;s
conduct had displeased him, for his eyes were again
gloomy and his brows wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use,&rdquo; he said, repulsing the mother,
who sought to conciliate her husband. &ldquo;I know
already what you will say, &lsquo;Children are children, and
I&rsquo;&mdash;well, certainly I am not always the tenderest of
fathers to his own. But how can one be so when
there is nothing for him but poverty, wretchedness,
and thirstiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ill-humoredly he threw off his cloak, and with a
gloomy countenance paced to and fro in the narrow
chamber. Ludwig and his mother quietly withdrew
to a corner. She could scarcely keep back the tears.
Her little son clung to her anxiously and tenderly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Some minutes passed in gloomy, oppressive stillness.
At last Johann Beethoven, without saying a
word, seated himself at the piano and touched the
keys. The tender tones which he drew from the
instrument seemed gradually to allay his agitation
and brighten his darkened countenance. He played
on, and finally began the pleasant melody of a folk-song,
gently humming it at first, and then singing it
with the full power of his voice.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the first tones of the song, the
little Ludwig raised his head and fixed his gaze
with rapt attention and glistening eyes upon his
father. As he began to sing aloud, the boy got
down from his mother&rsquo;s lap and, step by step,
unheard by his father, approached him, until he
stood close by his side, and clung to him as tenderly
as he had clung to his mother a moment before.
All his fears were dispelled by the soothing,
gentle tones of the music. He listened only to
them. All else was buried and forgotten. His
eyes were raised to heaven, he stood transfixed, and
his young soul fluttered, as if on wings, among the
soft modulations of the simple yet heart-stirring,
beautiful melody of the song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>His father stopped abruptly, turned round, and
saw the child standing near him, as it were, in a kind
of ecstasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ludwig, are you dreaming?&rdquo; he asked, not
harshly as before, but with an entirely changed and
softer tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, I was only listening to you,&rdquo; replied
the child, &ldquo;and it seemed to me that I heard an angel
singing in heaven. It was beautiful. Oh, if I
could only play something too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; said his father encouragingly, as he
placed the boy&rsquo;s fingers upon the keys. &ldquo;Keep
your fingers firm and let them follow as I guide
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Ludwig was greatly pleased. His father
repeated the melody which had so much delighted
him. After he had played it a few times, the boy
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right now, father. Now I can play it
all alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;You can hardly do
that yet. You are venturing a little too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only let me try,&rdquo; persisted the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His father let him do as he wished. He seated
himself at the piano; at first he ran his fingers over
the keys and then accurately began the folk melody,
which he played smoothly to the end without hesitation
or mistake.</p>
<p>His father, who had not expected any kind of
excellence in the performance, sat as if spell-bound
and regarded the boy with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youngster, truly there is more in you than I
have expected or thought of until to-day,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
and, taking him upon his knee, he kissed
his fresh, young lips. &ldquo;You will yet become a
finished musician, and a support for your father and
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish for nothing better than to be able to
make music correctly,&rdquo; said the boy, as he joyfully
clapped his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! No one shall prevent you, and I myself
will be your teacher,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;If you are
truly industrious, you will get ahead wonderfully,
provided you do not go too fast and will practise
regularly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>No sooner said than done. The father began at
once to teach his son the piano and the violin. At
first it seemed as if both father and son would enjoy
the work. But it was only at first. It was soon
apparent that the little Ludwig was possessed of the
most extraordinary obstinacy. The continual finger
and other dry exercises soon disgusted him, and he
played them with unconcealed and extreme reluctance.
He was willing to be faithful in his piano
practice, but only in his own, not in his father&rsquo;s way.
Owing to the latter&rsquo;s temper, this sometimes occasioned
violent scenes. Johann Beethoven was
easily excited to anger, and once irritated he lost
all control of himself. He hurled taunts and reproaches
at the boy, and boxed his ears; but Ludwig
bore it all with unyielding firmness, and confronted
his father defiantly in these outbreaks. Then his
mother would weep and earnestly beseech her husband
to have patience with the boy, who was too
little and childish to understand. She usually appeased
his anger, for, in reality, he was kind and
tender-hearted. The stubborn little fellow likewise
could not long withstand the piteous appeals of his
mother. His defiant heart at last would yield
to her caresses, and for a while he would good-naturedly
submit to his father&rsquo;s directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>But of course it was only for a little while. His
old obstinacy would continually block the way, and
sometimes the situation would become so intolerable
that the boy would declare he would have nothing
more to do with music. The violent outbreaks
would occur afresh. Reproaches, threats, and punishment
were not spared, but they served only to
make the boy still more obstinate and completely to
harden him against his father. In fact, the danger
that the little Beethoven might abandon music
altogether could not have been averted had not
the happy influence of his mother&rsquo;s loving appeals
continually drawn him back to its sweet
diversion.</p>
<p>There was still another thing that kept the
sacred flame alive in the breast of the boy, and
that was the frequent absence of his father, which
permitted him to follow the inclinations of his own
caprice and pleasure, and to draw beautiful accords
and melodies, now from the piano, now from the
violin.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion, when his father had treated
him with unusual severity and had looked at him
threateningly, the boy fled with his violin to his
little bed-chamber, and there, shut out from all the
world, gave vent to his anger and his sorrow in
mournful tones. As this did not help to allay his
inward tumults his mother, as a last expedient,
adopted a course which always had the happiest
result; namely, she told him of his dead grandfather,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
of whom the boy had preserved active
and loving memories, and whose life-sized portrait
hung in his chamber, thus keeping him freshly in
remembrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>This grandfather in his lifetime was a highly
esteemed and distinguished man, and had served as
chapelmaster for Max Frederick of Cologne. The
little Ludwig looked up to him as an exemplar for
his future life. When his mother told him how
beautifully he sang in the opera, what a fine, stately
man he was, and how high he stood in the favor of
his electoral patron, the boy listened with the most
eager attention to every word, and not infrequently
exclamations would escape from him, such as, &ldquo;I
shall have as great success,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I shall become a
famous man also, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the patient woman smiled, kissed the boy&rsquo;s
red cheeks, and all that had happened before between
father and son was buried in the sea of
forgetfulness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Some years passed in this way, ending as unsatisfactorily
for the father as for the son. The former,
when the little Ludwig was seven years old, at last
realized that his method of teaching was not adapted
to him and that they must look about for another
and more suitable teacher. Fortunately they found
such a one, first in the person of chapelmaster
Pfeiffer,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
later in court organist Van den Eeden,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
and then in court organist Neefe,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> all of whom instructed
him in piano, violin, and organ playing;
also in composition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Ludwig now made rapid and truly astonishing
progress in his art. The applause of his teachers
was accorded to him in most plentiful measure.
He developed into a capable and thorough musician.
Every one who knew him esteemed and loved
him; and yet the already mature boy was not inwardly
happy. There was a secret sorrow in his
breast, which embittered his life and dispelled all
his joyousness. He never had a glowing face and
laughing eyes, like other young men of his age.
Silent, reserved, and absorbed in himself, he went his
way, and many a one who saw him walking sadly
through the streets of Bonn looked wonderingly
after him, and probably said, &ldquo;That is a strange
expression of countenance for such a young fellow
to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, people knew not what oppressed the
young Beethoven and what had prematurely given
him such a serious and melancholy disposition.
Fortunately, however, the time was not far distant
which would bring him a friend in whom he could
fully confide, and to whom he could unreservedly
pour out all the cares and troubles of his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c2"><i>The Walk</i></h2>
<p>A divine spring day filled the beautiful
Rhine valley with radiance and light.
The surface of the river glistened as if
strewn with thousands of diamonds. On
the not far away &ldquo;Sieben Gebirge&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> hung a blue haze,
like a fine transparent veil, not concealing, but only
beautifying and softening the rugged outlines of the
peaks. The island of Nonnenwerth, with its bright
green foliage, was set in the river like an emerald,
and high above it on the left bank gleamed the red
ruins of the old castle of Rolandseck<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>&mdash;a suggestion
of the flight of time in the midst of the peaceful,
restful, perfect beauty of the present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>It was Sunday. Near and far sounded the peal
of bells. The crisp tones from the little chapels
and village churches mingled harmoniously with the
deep diapason of the great church bells in Bonn,
and with their trembling vibrations filled the beautiful
landscape, which seemed listening in prostrate
devotion. Hardly any other sound than that of
the bells could be distinguished. Even the little
song-birds, which a short time before had chirped
and twittered loudly and joyously, were now quiet.
Sunday peace and Sunday silence rested upon city
and plain.</p>
<p>A young man slowly walked along a path which
leads from Bonn down to the Rhine, threading its
way through fields and meadows. He was simply
and somewhat shabbily but neatly clad. One forgot,
however, his modest attire as one looked into
the face of the wanderer and saw those eyes in which
ever and anon bright gleams sparkled and revealed
the holy fire in his spirit. For the moment he had
no regard for the beauty of surrounding nature.
He only listened. His soul was floating, as it were,
in a sea of tones, which, now loudly, now softly,
like the breaking of ocean waves on the shore,
forced themselves upon his tensely strained nerves
and filled him with emotion. For a time he gazed
up into the bright blue sky with gleaming eyes, and
folded his hands upon his breast, like one in ecstasy,
as if thereby he could relieve this flood of rapture.
Then he advanced a few steps, but again paused,
and, muttering to himself some unintelligible exclamations,
flung both hands suddenly and wildly
about in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>He continued for a moment this strange action,
which not only would have caused a quiet passerby
to smile, but might have amazed him. His
amazement, however, would have lasted only until
he had seen the piercing eyes of the young man
and the lofty expression upon his brow, around
which hung thick, bushy hair like a lion&rsquo;s mane.
His eyes and forehead saved him from the ridicule
which his otherwise insignificant appearance might
have excited, and made it, if not exalted, at least
entitled to respect.</p>
<p>Softly the bells pealed on. Only a gentle and
gradually dying away murmur trembled in the almost
motionless air. The young man remained
immovable, his head bowed upon his breast, until
the last vibrations had died away. Then, like one
awakening from a dream, he raised his head and
looked around with a quiet, gentle glance. He
was already within a few hundred steps of the Rhine,
and on the opposite shore gleamed brightly and
hospitably the houses of K&ouml;nigswinter,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> above which
rose the lofty, huge, and majestic peaks of the
Seven Mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will go over there,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;The
day is so beautiful, one should improve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With quick steps he went down to the bank of
the river and sprang into one of the boats lying there,
saying to the boatman the single word, &ldquo;Across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived on the other side, he threw the boatman
a little silver piece and then took the first, best road
he came to and went on at random. Soon he found
himself in a shadowy beech wood, whose light green
leaves rustled high above him. In one lighter spot
he could see the blue sky through the foliage, and
here and there a sunbeam found its way through
the dense leaves and glistened at the young wanderer&rsquo;s
feet like a sparkling jewel or a bright silver
shield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>There were no people in the wood. The bustle
of the world did not penetrate its dusky recesses,
but, notwithstanding this, there was joyousness and
liveliness in its broad, dark halls. Numberless songbirds
swung on the slender branches or flew lightly
from bough to bough. The finches warbled their
lively, rollicking songs. The blackbirds and song
thrushes sang their soft and yet full-toned strophes.
In the distance the cuckoo intoned its name. The
young wanderer heard and watched it all, and, filled
with happy feelings, his face wore a more cheerful
aspect. No sound in this beautiful solitude escaped
his acute ears,&mdash;not the rustle of the leaves when a
gentle breeze stirred them; not the light gurgling
and splashing of the little brook along the bank of
which his course led him; not the rush of the water
when it plunged over rocks and made pretty little
waterfalls; not the tapping of the woodpecker,
whose strong bill pierced the bark of the tree that
concealed insects and larv&aelig;; not the sharp scream
of a large bird of prey, high overhead; and, least
of all, the ravishing song of a nightingale, which
suddenly rose from a thicket close by the side of
the lonely wanderer, so full, so tender, so pensive
and heart-stirring, that he remained motionless and
forgot all else that he might listen only to this
wonderful, inspiring song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brava, bravissima,&rdquo; he involuntarily exclaimed,
as the lovely singer shook its pretty feathers, and
then, following a gently alluring call, probably the
cry of its mate, flew as swiftly as an arrow through
the bushes. &ldquo;The utmost that can be accomplished
in a bird&rsquo;s throat is in thy song, charming Philomel;
but the artist still must create the higher things,&mdash;so
high that they bring him near to the divine. And
this height I will and shall attain, with God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man uttered these last words loudly
in the wood, but hardly had he done so when a
merry and mocking laugh came back in reply.
For an instant he felt a little frightened, but immediately
recovered himself, and angrily answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who laughs there? I hope no one here is
making sport of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken the liberty to do so,&rdquo; said a young
man, stepping forward from behind the trunk of a
beech-tree and making a low bow with a slightly
ironical smile. &ldquo;If you wish to resent it, honorable
sir, I herewith surrender myself to your merciful
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry frown which his words had caused disappeared,
and Beethoven good-naturedly extended
his hand, which the stranger cordially shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very learned Franz Gerhard Wegeler,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> worthy
student of medicine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what chance brought
you into this solitude, where I fancied I was all alone
and far from the human rabble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless the same chance which brought my
melodious friend here,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Yes,
my excellent master of tone, my Ludwig van Beethoven,
it was the blue sky and golden sun which
enticed me out of the dull study-room into God&rsquo;s
glorious world, where at least one can get a breath
of fresh air and enjoy the wonderful works of the
Almighty. Was not that your object also, worthy
pupil of Mistress Musica?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ludwig nodded assent. &ldquo;For all that, it is a
strange and remarkable chance that we should have
met each other in this solitary wood,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether strange and not very wonderful,
my dear fellow,&rdquo; replied Wegeler, &ldquo;for in crossing
the Rhine I engaged the same boatman who took
you over. Knowing that we were old acquaintances,
he told me that you had crossed scarcely half an
hour before, and were roving about in this wood.
As I would rather have company than walk alone,
I followed your trail, found you lost in ecstasy over
a nightingale, and finally learned, for you announced
it in an exceedingly loud tone of voice, that you
intended shortly to soar to the very Deity. That
made me laugh; but you will excuse me when you
reflect that the ascent to the Deity is a somewhat
difficult performance for one of your years, unless
you make what they call a &lsquo;salto mortale&rsquo; (deadly
leap). It is the easiest way in the world to break
one&rsquo;s neck or bones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Ludwig again frowned a little, but quickly smoothed
his brow with his hand, as if wiping away all troubles
and gloomy thoughts. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I was a fool to entertain such bold fancies and
daring hopes. And this, too, in my melancholy
circumstances and wretched plight! It is not possible.
I was mad, that I was.&rdquo; With these last
words such deep dejection manifested itself in his
countenance that Wegeler suddenly felt the warmest
sympathy for the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Why do you speak of
wretchedness and melancholy, Ludwig?&rdquo; he cordially
said, as he threw his arm around his much
younger friend and drew him affectionately toward
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you know not&mdash;no one knows&mdash;what it
is that depresses and weighs me down,&rdquo; answered
Ludwig. &ldquo;Poverty is such a heavy burden. It
rests like a load upon the pinions of the soul. Oh,
it is awful to feel here, here in one&rsquo;s inmost soul,
that one could accomplish the great and the beautiful,
and yet not be able to do it because he lacks
a few miserable gulden and kreuzers. It is hard,
Wegeler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears stood in young Beethoven&rsquo;s eyes, and his
lips quivered in the effort to repress his emotions.
Wegeler&rsquo;s eyes rested with an expression of deep
sympathy upon the dejected figure which he had
seen only a short time before exulting in the joyousness
of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ludwig,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;and his voice had an unusually
tender tone,&mdash;&ldquo;I pray you, open your heart
to me, and do not conceal what troubles and oppresses
you. I feel for you as for a true and sincere friend.
Take me for your friend and then speak, for you
know between true heart-friends there should be
no restraint, no secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; said Ludwig. &ldquo;Would you actually
be my true friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the last hour of my life. I swear it,&rdquo; said
Wegeler, in such an honest manner that his sincerity
could not be doubted.</p>
<p>Ludwig understood him and was comforted. With
an exclamation of joy he embraced Wegeler and
kissed him. &ldquo;So we are friends, always friends,&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Oh, how I have longed for a soul that
could and would understand me, and lo, at last I
have found one. Now you shall learn, dear, good
Wegeler, what has disturbed my soul and checked its
flights. I am not happy, and the cause of my unhappiness,
alas, is my father&rsquo;s conduct. I have
kept this melancholy secret deeply hidden in my
breast, but here, where no one but the dear God
and the little birds can hear, I will disclose it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>With an exclamation of joy he embraced Wegeler</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>He told in passionate words how his father&rsquo;s
temper had made him suffer from the days of his
childhood, of that father&rsquo;s insatiable craving for
drink, and how, on that account, the family often
had to go without the necessaries of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though my father naturally is good-natured,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;this craving makes him exceedingly
irritable and sometimes violent. His habits drive
him to extremes. At one moment he is a tender
father, at the next a cruel tyrant. The despair of it
all is that when necessity and trouble press hardest
he has no patience to bear, but seeks consolation
and forgetfulness in wine. This is my heaviest
burden, for, so long as he cannot resist drinking,
there is no hope of better conditions for our family.
My mother, my good, true, tender mother, secretly
weeps, and bears her hard lot with Christian calmness.
But I and my two younger brothers<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> suffer
unspeakably, and many a time I have been tempted
to throw myself into the Rhine and end all my
miseries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, dear boy,&rdquo; said Wegeler soothingly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so vehement. I am free to
acknowledge that your situation is bad and gloomy
enough, but bad as it is, some relief will be found.
Let me think it over. For the present banish your
sad thoughts, and let us enjoy the delicious atmosphere,
the blue sky, the green woods, and the
sparkling sunshine. This is not a day for melancholy.
Cheer up! Let us go farther into the wood
and visit my good friends, the monks of the Heisterbach
cloister. We shall be well received there, and
in any case find a good breakfast, which doubtless
we shall greatly relish after the morning tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Ludwig was ready to accept his friend&rsquo;s guidance.
They sprang up from the mossy bank upon which
they had been sitting during their conversation, and
followed a small, scarcely perceptible footpath that
led through the wood. Wegeler chattered about
everything possible, told his new friend many
humorous and pleasant stories, and quickly succeeded
in cheering him up. When they reached
the Heisterbach cloister, shortly before noon, Ludwig&rsquo;s
melancholy had given place to a somewhat
defiant but still good humor.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the grounds sat the Father
Doorkeeper, apparently basking in the sunshine.
He regarded the new-comers with a pleasant smile
on his broad, rosy face. &ldquo;Welcome, Herr Studiosus,&rdquo;
he said to Wegeler,&mdash;for he had made his
acquaintance in previous visits. &ldquo;Have you been
here long? The Abbot and the others also will be
glad to see you again. Enter without any ceremony&mdash;that
way&mdash;but you already know the way to the
refectory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s greeting for your friendly reception,
Father Doorkeeper,&rdquo; replied Wegeler. &ldquo;We come
hungry and thirsty, and kindly ask you for a cordial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apply to the chief cook. You may be certain
he knows no greater pleasure than feeding the hungry
and providing a strengthening cordial.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Wegeler bowed and proceeded with Ludwig
through the forecourt, which, with its flower-beds,
fountains, and cleanly kept gravel walks, looked like
a garden. Arrived at the abbey, they were cordially
greeted anew and escorted to the refectory,&mdash;a
cool hall, with great Gothic window recesses, in
which, so roomy were they, tables with stone slabs
were standing. The monk cordially invited them to
be seated at one of these tables and then left to announce
in kitchen and cellar that two beloved guests
laid claim to hospitality. In reply to the Father
Chief Cook he gave the name of the student Wegeler,
and at once several ministering spirits actively
began to prepare food and drink in abundance for
the welcome strangers. Hardly ten minutes after
the arrival of Wegeler and Ludwig a hearty breakfast
was served upon the side table, which was
covered with a neat cloth, and then came the
Father Cellar-Master striding along, under each
arm a carafe of costly, sparkling golden wine, from
which he filled the glasses of his guests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Wegeler and Ludwig thoroughly enjoyed the
pleasure of this large-hearted hospitality, and paid it
due honor by partaking abundantly of the food and
emptying more than one glass of the delicious wine.
The monks asked for the latest news in Bonn, the
cream of which Wegeler was giving them, when the
Abbot himself, with his friend the Father Lector,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
appeared, and greeted his guests with the same
friendliness the other inmates of the abbey had
shown. Naturally he was somewhat reserved with
Ludwig, as he did not yet know him, and only
recognized him with a nod of the head; but he
was soon engaged in a lively conversation with
Wegeler about the affairs of the new university at
Bonn, in which the venerable man showed a special
interest.</p>
<p>As Ludwig could take no part in this conversation,
and as the attention of all the other cloister
brothers was also devoted to the Abbot and Wegeler,
he found time hanging heavily. He arose,
slipped out of the refectory unnoticed, and enjoyed
himself strolling around the abbey and the grounds,
observing and admiring notable and interesting objects.
While thus wandering about at pleasure, he
came to the beautiful church of the abbey, and at
once noticed its large handsome organ, which naturally
had a greater attraction for him as a musician
than anything else. He went up into the choir,
scrutinized the organ closely, and admired its beautiful
construction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad the organ-blower is not here,&rdquo; he
said aloud, for he did not suppose there was any
one else in the church. &ldquo;It would be the greatest
pleasure to me to try such a splendid organ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! who is talking there?&rdquo; said an entirely
unexpected voice, and out of the organ-blower&rsquo;s
closet stepped a serving brother, who regarded
Ludwig with astonishment. &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Did I not hear something about Monsieur
wishing he could play the organ? Are you
the Monsieur who wanted an organ-blower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, it must have been I, since no one
else but ourselves is at present in the church,&rdquo; replied
Ludwig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the man in amazement, and looking
somewhat doubtfully at the short, thick-set figure
of Beethoven, &ldquo;does Monsieur say that he can
play the organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Ludwig; &ldquo;I could easily
convince you if only there were a blower at hand
who was willing to serve me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the organ-blower,&rdquo; said the man, shaking
his head and still somewhat doubtful. &ldquo;If you are
really in earnest about playing the organ I will
right gladly offer my service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is fine, perfectly splendid,&rdquo; cried Ludwig
exultantly. &ldquo;To your post, worthy colleague.
We will both take the utmost pains and each one
of us do his best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still dubiously and suspiciously shaking his head,
the organ-blower took his place, but left the door
ajar so that no tone of the young man&rsquo;s playing
should escape him. Ludwig seated himself, struck
the keys with his strong hands, and evoked from
the splendid instrument a stream, a full volume of
tones, such as had never been heard in the church
before. Majestically they rang through the church
like the thunder of the Lord. Then suddenly there
were soft and gentle tones like the vibrations of the
harp, a heavenly melody, sung as it were by the voices
of angels, anon pealing out grandly in a majestic
hymn, like a song of praise from the heavens and
the earth, glorifying the Eternal, the only God, the
Almighty Creator of heaven and earth. Powerful
as the solemn tones had been, they died away again
to a soft and lovely piano, until at the close the last
sound exhaled itself like a breath and seemed softly
to disappear among the lofty columns of the choir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Beethoven, who had sat like one entranced during
his wonderful playing, and had looked upwards
with fixed, wide-open eyes, now came to himself,
wiped the perspiration from his heated brow, and
drew a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, who taught you to play like that?&rdquo;
said a man in the dress of the order, advancing out
of the dusk of the organ-loft. &ldquo;Truly, you play
magnificently. I have never heard such execution
before. Who taught you this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I taught myself,&rdquo; Beethoven replied curtly and
somewhat aggressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be doubly greeted and doubly welcome,
noble disciple of the art, who sometime will make a
high and mighty eagle&rsquo;s flight,&rdquo; said the monk with
deep earnestness as he grasped the young man&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;Turn not away from me. I am also a
member of the great guild which has devoted its
lifework to Mistress Musica. I am the Father
Organist of the abbey, and hence I am qualified to
appreciate and admire your wonderful art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s darkening countenance quickly lightened
up as he recognized in the venerable monk
not an officious, inquisitive person, but a colleague,
and he warmly returned the grasp of his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your kindness, Father,&rdquo; he
gently replied, &ldquo;but you praise me too highly. I
am not yet worthy of it, but I hope and shall
strive to deserve it sometime. But now, what can I
do to show my gratitude for your gracious words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat what you have just played, my son,&rdquo;
said the father. &ldquo;Your playing has touched my
old heart powerfully. Those were not earthly tones;
they were the harmonies and melodies of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; that was only a free Fantasie of my
own,&rdquo; said Ludwig. &ldquo;To repeat it would be somewhat
of a task, but I will gladly play something else
for you, if you will wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father nodded assent and retired to a dark
corner, where he could abandon himself to his anticipated
enjoyment without any danger of being
disturbed. Beethoven ran his fingers over the keys
several times, as if searching for a theme, until he
found a soft old melody, which he played through in
simple, noble style, and then varied with marvellous
skill and ingenuity. As the ravishing tones powerfully
and ever more powerfully rang out, the church
gradually filled up. The monks slipped in in
groups. The Father Head Cook left his kitchen
and the Father Doorkeeper his door to listen to the
young man&rsquo;s playing, reports of which had quickly
spread through the abbey. The Abbot and the
Father Lector also came, in Wegeler&rsquo;s company,
went up into the organ-loft, and seated themselves
just behind Beethoven, who, lost in inspiration, was
not aware of their presence. He continued playing
variations until the theme was completely exhausted,
and then, weary and exhausted himself, bowed his
head upon his breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>A unanimous &ldquo;Brava, brava,&rdquo; resounded through
the church. The Abbot stepped forward, tapped
him gently on the shoulder, and said with emotion:
&ldquo;Those were indeed sounds from another world,
and they have penetrated my very soul. Accept my
thanks, my young friend. You are truly a master,
and a great future lies before you if God preserve
your life and health, which I doubt not He will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lector also spoke words of praise to the
young man. The Father Organist bowed low before
him. The organ-blower emerged from his
closet and with astonishment regarded the young
man who had accomplished such prodigies and unprecedented
feats in his art. &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the
homely old man, &ldquo;if he played the organ here I
would never get tired. My old arms would work
the bellows from morning to night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Beethoven in the meantime accepted these praises
somewhat coolly and indifferently, and contented
himself by expressing his thanks with an awkward
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is always thus, your reverence,&rdquo; said Wegeler,
as he seated himself again with the Abbot and
the Father Lector at the wine in the cool refectory&mdash;&ldquo;a
sound kernel in a rough shell; a jewel of the
purest water, which needs only a little polish to
glisten at its real value. He is not to blame for it so
much as his unhappy domestic conditions. How can
he have politeness and ease of manner when there
is not even daily bread in the house? I beg you
therefore to treat him with gracious indulgence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is entirely unnecessary to intercede for this
young genius,&rdquo; replied the Abbot. &ldquo;His magnificent
playing has impressed me so deeply that I can
overlook his lack of courtesy, though really his deportment
is a little awkward. One must bear with
everything in a great genius,&mdash;and such he is,
for, after what we have heard, there cannot be the
slightest doubt of it. I should greatly like to talk
with him a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should not be surprised if he had already
slipped out of the church and were again roving
about the wood,&rdquo; said Wegeler smiling. &ldquo;I know
his ways. He does not crave praise like many
other musicians. It is absolutely painful to him
to be commended to his face. He prefers to escape
from it and bury himself in solitude. He is
always that way, and one must take him as one finds
him. The rich treasures of his soul make thousandfold
compensation for his external roughness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall have to acquiesce in his absence,&rdquo;
replied the Abbot; &ldquo;but promise me, dear Wegeler,
that you will soon bring this wonderful artist here
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure,&rdquo; answered Wegeler.
&ldquo;Ludwig can do his best in the company of cultivated
and sympathetic persons only, and I hope
I shall succeed in introducing him into a circle of
dear friends in Bonn where he will surely find a second
home. But now, your reverence, it is time for
me to take my departure and hunt up my young
runaway friend, so that we may get back to Bonn
in good season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Once again the glasses were filled, and they were
clinked for the last time with the wish for an early
and happy &ldquo;Wiedersehen,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> and Wegeler begged
to be kept in affectionate remembrance. He then
hastened in the direction of Bonn, and had been
gone hardly a quarter of an hour when he found
his friend Beethoven sitting upon a stump on the
side of the road, lost in deep thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my fine fellow,&rdquo; said Wegeler to him,
&ldquo;what induced you to run away from the abbey so
secretly and without saying good-bye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven turned about with an abrupt motion
of resentment and shook his thick, curly hair, which
fell about his neck like the mane of a lion. &ldquo;I
could not stay any longer and indulge in empty chattering
after the Genius of Art in the church had
struggled with me and bidden me to soar. I had to
get away from it and out into the open air, into the
solitude, where, as I know by experience, I can most
easily find my way back to the common places of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Abbot regretted that he could not
speak with you again,&rdquo; said Wegeler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other time,&rdquo; replied Beethoven. &ldquo;He is
a kind, friendly man, whom I appreciate and esteem;
but he must let me go my way, undisturbed, if I am
to visit him again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he will do that, stubborn-headed one,&rdquo; replied
Wegeler, laughingly. &ldquo;Only play for him a
little from time to time and he will always be a benevolent
patron and have all possible patience with
your caprices. We do not always know how, when,
or where such a man may be of service to us. A
visit with him is always a genuine recreation and a
comfort to the heart. We will soon revisit Heisterbach,
will we not, Ludwig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven nodded assent. &ldquo;But it is time now
to go home. The sun is already low, and I have a
presentiment that things are not as they should be
at home. Let us hasten, Wegeler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They quickened their pace. Soon they reached
the Rhine, crossed it, and went on to Bonn, which
was already growing dim in the gathering twilight.
When their ways separated they parted from one
another, but Wegeler promised he would certainly
visit Beethoven the next evening, and hoped that he
would bring him some good and cheering news.
With a last cordial shake of the hand they separated,
and Beethoven flew rather than walked through the
streets, that he might reach his dwelling in the narrow
and gloomy Bonn Gasse as quickly as possible;
for it was already late, and the house door might be
closed with the coming of darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c3"><i>New Friends</i></h2>
<p>Wegeler kept his word. With a
beaming countenance he appeared at
Beethoven&rsquo;s house the next evening
and exultantly said: &ldquo;I have succeeded.
Congratulate yourself, friend Ludwig! I
shall introduce you this evening to a family with
whom you will feel perfectly at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind of a family might that be?&rdquo; said
Beethoven, distrustfully. &ldquo;You know I am not
adapted to all the world, and that all the world is
not adapted to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this family is in no way of the character
which you so sweepingly apply to the world,&rdquo; replied
Wegeler. &ldquo;You will find it a model of the
noblest sociality and a place where art and science
are most zealously cherished. It is the family of
the widow, Frau Hofrathin von Breuning,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> to which
I have permission to introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the Frau Hofrathin von Breuning,&rdquo; cried
Ludwig, with a perceptibly brighter countenance.
&ldquo;Truly that is something different from what I
mean by &lsquo;all the world.&rsquo; I have heard of this
family. They are lovely people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the world, Ludwig,&rdquo; eagerly protested
Wegeler. &ldquo;So hasten. Get yourself in
readiness. They are expecting us immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am already dressed,&rdquo; replied Beethoven,
haughtily. &ldquo;I have no other coat than this threadbare
one. If they won&rsquo;t have me in this, they shall
not have me at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unruly, stubborn, cross-grained fellow that you
are!&rdquo; exclaimed Wegeler, with a laugh. &ldquo;Will
you never learn to master your capricious nature?
Come along even in your threadbare coat. These
dear people into whose circle I shall take you
care only for your heart and disposition, not for
your clothes. You are, like all geniuses, a most
ridiculous fellow. But that does not signify. You
already know them, and consequently you will learn
to appreciate them. Frankly, you should not appear
wilful and capricious, but behave like a polite
youth, and occasionally perform something on the
piano in your own style. They are very fond of
music and have much of it at their home. The
Elector&rsquo;s chapelmaster Ries,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> whom you know, and
other members of the chapel, often enjoy pleasant
intercourse in this hospitable home, and we certainly
shall meet some of them there this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that is a splendid suggestion,&rdquo; said Beethoven,
with gleaming eyes. &ldquo;Then I can appear
as I am. Yes, they shall learn to know me! I
have composed to-day a trio for pianoforte, violin,
and violoncello. We will take it with us. If a violin
and violoncello can be had I will play the piano, and
they will open their eyes, these people, when they
hear my composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! you have plenty of confidence that you
have made something particularly good and beautiful,&rdquo;
said Wegeler in gentle banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have,&rdquo; replied Beethoven, with self-assurance.
&ldquo;I tell you I have created something
entirely new, which will please every one of good
musical taste and will be widely imitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But consider, Ludwig; you will be judged not
by dilettanti, but by genuine connoisseurs,&rdquo; said
Wegeler, earnestly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; proudly replied Ludwig.
&ldquo;I never intend to compose for ignorance and
stupidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, take your trio. We will make a
trial of it,&rdquo; said Wegeler. &ldquo;Or, what is better, give
it to me. I will say that it is a composition by one
of my acquaintances. If it does not please, we need
not mention your name; but if it pleases, as I wish
and hope it may, then, at least, you may be sure they
will not flatter or over-praise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; answered Ludwig, as he
handed the manuscript to his friend, who placed it
in his pocket. &ldquo;Now I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will start, for they will be waiting for
us at the Breunings&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Wegeler.</p>
<p>Arm in arm they went through the already silent
and dark streets until they came to a handsome
house, before the door of which hung a lighted lantern.
Wegeler was no stranger there. He conducted
Ludwig up a broad, easy flight of steps,
opened the door, and led his somewhat timid young
friend into a spacious and brilliantly lighted apartment,
in which a company of twelve persons was
assembled. An elderly lady, whose face still revealed
traces of beauty, and with an unusually noble
and gracious expression of goodness and benevolence,
advanced a few steps and received them with
a kindly smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, dear Wegeler,&rdquo; she said in a soft,
gentle voice which came straight from the heart; &ldquo;I
think I make no mistake in welcoming in your
companion my future young friend, Ludwig van
Beethoven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied Wegeler.
&ldquo;This is my friend Ludwig, and this, Ludwig, is the
Frau Hofrathin von Breuning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, cordially welcome, dear Beethoven,&rdquo;
said the Frau Hofrathin, extending her hand with
friendly and very motherly good wishes.</p>
<p>Beethoven was by nature a strong, proud character,
who did not easily bow before any one, and
least of all was inclined to waste much civility in
social intercourse. The amiability of Frau von
Breuning, however, made such a deep impression
upon him that he took the hand offered him, bowed
low, and kissed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>In the meantime the others present came forward.
The sons of Frau von Breuning&mdash;Stephen, Christopher,
and Lenz&mdash;shook the young man&rsquo;s hand cordially,
and then the sister, Eleonora, welcomed him
with a cordial inclination of the head and bright,
friendly eyes. Some of the guests already knew
Ludwig, particularly the chapelmaster Ries, and
some members of the Elector&rsquo;s chapel. He exchanged
a few friendly words with them and was
then presented to a handsome, distinguished looking
man, the Count von Waldstein,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> who, notwithstanding
his high rank and standing, greeted him with
genuine cordiality. In a short time Beethoven felt
as much at home in this circle as if he had been in
it for years, and Wegeler therefore quietly indulged
the hope that his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; would bring no
discredit upon his urgent recommendations of him.
He was in no way disappointed in this hope. Beethoven
appeared more cheerful, companionable,
frank, and affable than ever before, and when the
talk turned upon music he seated himself at the
piano without being urged, much to Wegeler&rsquo;s astonishment
and delight, and played a long time
with such a splendid technique and depth of feeling
that all conversation at once stopped and every one
paid the closest attention to his beautiful melodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brava, brava!&rdquo; cried every one when the young
artist finished his performance. Count Waldstein
stepped up to him and tapped him lightly
on the shoulder. &ldquo;You have indeed done splendidly,&rdquo;
he cordially said. &ldquo;I fancy that I also
understand music a little, and therefore speak so
positively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapelmaster Ries complimented Ludwig so enthusiastically
that he felt extremely comfortable as
well as happy. Wegeler thought it an opportune
time to try the new trio, and took it from his pocket.
&ldquo;As we are engaged with music,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as
we have professional artists right at hand, I would
beg you to play an entirely new composition, which
by a happy chance has come into my possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said chapelmaster Ries, &ldquo;and who
is the composer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The composer wishes temporarily to remain
unknown,&rdquo; replied Wegeler, &ldquo;but the work is a trio
for piano, violin, and violoncello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged without any difficulty,&rdquo;
said Ries. &ldquo;Our Beethoven will play the pianoforte,
friend Muller the violoncello, and I will undertake
the violin. The instruments are here, so let
us get to work at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>In a few minutes the necessary arrangements were
made and the trio began. The three accomplished
artists easily played it at sight, and the audience paid
close attention to the entirely original harmonies and
melodies. The trio was played to its close smoothly
and with precision, but instead of loud applause after
the last tones there was a very painful silence. The
good Wegeler turned pale with anxiety, but Beethoven
sat as proud as Jupiter at the piano and
seemed to have forgotten where or in whose company
he was.</p>
<p>Chapelmaster Ries was the first to break the uncomfortable
silence and, turning quickly to Wegeler,
said: &ldquo;This is truly a charming composition, full
of originality, and developed with true genius.
Who is the composer? I am really eager to know,
for I never before have heard such music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, very strong but characteristic,&rdquo; Count
Waldstein added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard anything more beautiful,&rdquo; said
Christopher Breuning, enthusiastically and excitedly.
&ldquo;It must be an entirely distinctive art-work by
Mozart, or perhaps something of Haydn&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Wegeler, who had regained his natural color,
smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;Neither Mozart nor
Haydn,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The composer is a new man,
and is in our midst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Count Waldstein,&rdquo; said Frau von Breuning
with a light, graceful bow. &ldquo;Do not deny it,
Count. You have prepared a most pleasant surprise
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, dear lady, I should consider
myself most fortunate if I could accept your compliment,&rdquo;
replied Count Waldstein, &ldquo;but I must
reluctantly decline it. Probably we have to thank
our chapelmaster for the great surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the chapelmaster, &ldquo;I will not
adorn myself with borrowed feathers however beautiful
they may be. But really, if I could accomplish
such a work as this trio, I should regard myself as
a pretty good artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who can the composer be if he is neither
our dear Count nor the chapelmaster?&rdquo; said Frau
von Breuning. &ldquo;Surely you are just teasing us a
little, dear Wegeler. Anyway, the composer of the
trio is known by name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has a name,&rdquo; said Wegeler, smiling,
&ldquo;but his name is not yet famous, though I have
no doubt it will become so one day. The composer&rsquo;s
name is&mdash;<span class="sc">Ludwig van Beethoven</span>, and
he has the honor to sit before your ladyship, at the
piano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a bomb had fallen into the company it could
not have caused greater astonishment than Wegeler&rsquo;s
simple announcement. All present evidently were
surprised in the highest degree. Beethoven alone
sat entirely unmoved and at ease, and looked about
him smilingly and unembarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there to be astonished at?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I composed the entire trio to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hard to describe the effect these few words
produced. All crowded around Beethoven, and
each had his word of admiration for him. He was
quietly pleased when they shook his hand and
overwhelmed him with compliments; but at last he
became uneasy, and sprang up from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is too much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not deserve
it. Later, years hence, perhaps,&mdash;but now? no!
There are still those who can construct better things
than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are very few of them,&rdquo; said Count
Waldstein, earnestly. &ldquo;Anyway, I feel impelled to
exercise all my influence for the advancement of a
talent such as yours, dear Beethoven. I beg you to
consider me as your fatherly friend and patron.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Beethoven bowed, and stammered a few words
of thanks. A moment later he had forgotten the
assurances of the Count and was chatting in the
most intimate manner with the sons of Frau von
Breuning, who welcomed this talented new acquaintance
with genuine enthusiasm. The mother also
graciously conversed with the young man, and at
last asked him if he would at some future time
give piano lessons to her daughter Eleonora, which
Beethoven naturally was glad to promise.</p>
<p>As it was getting rather late, the company left
one after another. Beethoven withdrew with
Wegeler, and warmly thanked his friend on the
street for introducing him into this pleasant family
circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did it with all my heart,&rdquo; said Wegeler, &ldquo;and
with the hope that it will be for the pleasure and
advantage of both parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of Wegeler&rsquo;s hopes were realized. Beethoven
soon found himself at home among his new friends.
This was not strange, for the Hofrathin entertained
a true motherly affection for him, and her children
regarded him as a brother. Beethoven himself, at
a later period, often declared that his happiest years
were spent in the Breuning home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Thus weeks and months passed. Beethoven&rsquo;s
outward circumstances gradually improved, for the
Hofrathin Breuning was assiduous in procuring
pupils for him among her acquaintances, which
paid well at that time. Ludwig could now furnish
a part of the support for his brave mother, so
that matters gradually became more pleasant in the
household life. Everything contributed to keep
him in good humor, so that he commended himself
more and more to the affection and good-will of his
new friends.</p>
<p>Ludwig had heard nothing for a long time from
Count Waldstein about the patronage he had promised.
In reality he had hardly given it a thought.
But the Hofrathin Breuning many a time quietly
wondered that the Count should have forgotten his
prot&eacute;g&eacute; so quickly and completely, &ldquo;especially
when there is so much he might do for his advantage,&rdquo;
she said to herself. &ldquo;He is a favorite with the
Elector, and hardly needs do more than drop a word
occasionally to interest him in our Beethoven. If
he would do so but once, everything else would take
care of itself, and I should no longer have any anxiety
about the young man&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>But none of the Hofrathin&rsquo;s wishes or hopes
seemed likely to be realized. Count Waldstein
appeared now and then in the Hofrathin&rsquo;s social
circle, but seldom remained there long, and seemed
to concern himself little about Beethoven, though
at times he gave him a friendly word. One evening,
however, he asked for the trio which Beethoven
composed, and requested permission to keep it a
few days. The permission naturally was granted
promptly and willingly, although Beethoven did
not appear to attach the slightest importance to
the Count&rsquo;s request. Frau von Breuning, however,
smiled to herself in silent satisfaction. She anticipated
and conjectured more than Ludwig, and this
simple, unimportant act aroused the hope that something
would come of it, and that his interests would
be promoted.</p>
<p>Nothing in the least occurred in the next few
days to confirm these hopes, and Frau von Breuning,
though she still clung to her hope, had to
admit to herself there was little foundation for it,
when one evening Count Waldstein appeared entirely
unexpectedly in the circle of friends who were
entertaining themselves with music. Besides the
Breuning family, Beethoven, Wegeler, and chapelmaster
Ries were present. All extended a respectful
and friendly greeting to the Count. He smiled
contentedly, roguishly looked at Beethoven, and
pressed his right hand upon his left breast-pocket,
in which something light rustled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said good-humoredly, &ldquo;what
do you imagine I am carrying here in my coat-pocket?
Guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I guess, Count?&rdquo; replied Ludwig.
&ldquo;It must be something of considerable importance,
since Your Grace is so mysterious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, important enough for certain people,
though to me simply pleasant and agreeable. But
I already perceive you are not gifted with the faculty
of guessing, dear Ludwig, so I must help you a
little. This mysterious thing in my pocket is a
document from the electoral court. I got sight of
the address there, and incidentally, as I intended to
visit my worthy friend here, I took the document
with the intention of handing it to the person addressed.
He is a certain Ludwig van Beethoven,
and I was sure I should find him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A document from the electoral court to me!
Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Beethoven, at first astonished
and then delighted, while the kindly face of
Frau von Breuning was lit up with joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, to you, my young friend,&rdquo; said the
Count, as he removed the document from his pocket.
&ldquo;Here, take it. Open it, and see what the Elector
has done for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven slowly took the large envelope, looked
at the address and seal, and shook his head. &ldquo;The
Count doubtless is only making sport of me,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;If I break the seal I shall only be heartily
laughed at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you most distrustful of all distrustful men
and musicians!&rdquo; the Count replied. &ldquo;How can
you entertain such a foolish supposition? Open it!
Open it! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; replied Beethoven, firmly, as he
placed the envelope on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You foolish fellow, you can do as you please,
of course,&rdquo; said the Count, a little impatiently.
&ldquo;This much I know, however, that our most gracious
lord, the Elector, has not done this for a
fool, but for his court organist, and this highest of
all honors he has bestowed upon you in this document.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Beethoven.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; joyfully said the Hofrathin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! splendid!&rdquo; cried all the others.</p>
<p>Beethoven was so overcome with astonishment
that he seemed as rigid as a statue, but at a sign
from the Count, chapelmaster Ries opened the envelope,
showed the signature of the Elector, and the
appointment of Ludwig van Beethoven as court
organist, carefully drawn up in due form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearty congratulations, Ludwig,&rdquo; said he, handing
the document to him. &ldquo;I call this good fortune,
even if it does come to the one most deserving of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All present surrounded Beethoven and congratulated
him. He received their good wishes with a
radiant smile and beaming eyes. Then he suddenly
rushed to Count Waldstein, pressed his lips to his
hand, and exclaimed to him from the fulness of his
heart, &ldquo;Thanks! thanks! my benefactor!&rdquo; Thereupon
he seized his hat, crying joyously, &ldquo;To my
mother, to my good mother! Good-night to all!&rdquo;&mdash;and
was out of the house as quick as a flash.</p>
<p>No one wondered at his somewhat strange behavior.
All knew him and his ways and manners, and
all were his friends, which signified for him all that
was sincerely true and good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c4"><i>A Merciful Punishment</i></h2>
<p>Good fortune often arouses jealousies and
enmities, for while there are many good
men in the world, there are also many
base and evil-minded ones. Beethoven
was destined to make this discovery at once. His
appointment as court organist was received by most
of the members of the electoral chapel with expressions
of great discontent, and some of them
did not conceal their resentment that such a green
young student should have been selected as their
colleague. Of course it never occurred to these
narrow-minded persons that there was more creative
skill in this &ldquo;green student&rdquo; than in the whitening
heads of all these old musical pedants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Beethoven was one who troubled himself very
little about such displays of petty hatred and jealousy.
As he was exempt from the pressing anxieties
of everyday life by his position and teaching,
and had found in Count Waldstein a truly good and
fatherly patron, he carried his head high, and looked
down with proud self-assurance upon his enemies.
Not that he had grown supercilious,&mdash;nothing was
farther from him than that,&mdash;but he could clearly
discriminate between himself and these malicious
ones. He knew that he surpassed them as far as
the heavens are above the earth.</p>
<p>It happened one day that Count Waldstein called
upon his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and found him deeply absorbed
in a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this, Ludwig?&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;I expected
to find you busy at the piano, or with the
violin, and now I catch you reading an insipid
novel! Shame on you, my young friend! In
your difficult art there is but one road to success&mdash;&lsquo;forward,
always forward.&rsquo; You should not waste
time on trifles if you expect to accomplish great
and important things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first words of his patron Beethoven had
arisen, and greeted him in the most cordial manner.
His manner did not change, however, when the
Count reproached him; on the contrary, he handed
him the book he was reading, and smilingly said:
&ldquo;Excuse me, this is not a trifle, Count; it is &lsquo;Plutarch&rsquo;s
Lives,&rsquo; but unfortunately only a good translation,
for I cannot read it in the original.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Count&rsquo;s frown began to disappear. &ldquo;Of
course I cannot disapprove of good reading. But
I see you have more books. Are they all Plutarch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, worthy sir,&rdquo; replied Beethoven, excitedly, as
he took his books and quickly opened them one
after another. &ldquo;This is Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey, these
are Plato&rsquo;s writings, this the Odes of Horace, and
these a few volumes of Shakespeare&mdash;all classical
literature.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see; but of what use are they to
you?&rdquo; said the Count, wonderingly. &ldquo;Do you learn
anything about music in them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Herr Count,&rdquo; replied Beethoven,
&ldquo;but I am acquiring the general information which
all composers and musicians should have. You
perhaps are not aware that in consequence of my
parents&rsquo; poverty I could not attend a good school.
The natural result was that I learned very little,
and now, if I am not to be an ignoramus, I must
make up by my own exertions what I lost in childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is really quite another thing,&rdquo; said the
Count, approvingly, &ldquo;and instead of censuring you,
I ought to have praised you for your zeal and industry.
In reality I have called to-day neither to
blame nor to praise you, but for an entirely different
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it is, Herr Count. I am entirely
at your pleasure,&rdquo; said Beethoven, eagerly. &ldquo;You
will make me very happy by assigning me to any
position where I can be of the slightest service to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, dear Ludwig! I knew as much
when I applied to you,&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;And
now to the point. A Ritter ballet is to be given
at the forthcoming carnival for the pleasure of His
Highness, the Elector. Those who are to participate
in it are already engaged, and the sketch and
text are prepared and contained in this roll. The
music alone is lacking. Will you do me the favor
to compose it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be a thousand times delighted,&rdquo; said
Beethoven. He took the roll as if it had been a
precious treasure. &ldquo;I will take the utmost pains to
meet your expectations, so that I may not only show
my gratitude to you, my most esteemed patron, but
also to my most gracious lord and Prince. At what
time must the music be ready, Herr Count?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can have at least four weeks,&rdquo; replied the
Count. &ldquo;Therefore do not be in too much haste.
When you are ready let me know. Adieu, and good
luck, my young friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven applied himself with enthusiastic zeal
to the composition of the different parts which were
necessary for the performance of the ballet, and was
able to give the work to Count Waldstein before
the expiration of the allotted four weeks. The
Count, himself a clever musician, or at least a well-schooled
amateur, glanced over the score with experienced
eyes, nodded several times in a satisfied
way, and smiled to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, my friend,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I hope
the music will please. You are to conduct. I
have this further suggestion to make. I know the
prejudices of many of your colleagues against you.
If they know that you composed the ballet music,
then the envious ones will seize the opportunity
to play badly, and thereby intentionally spoil the
pretty music. Keep it secret until after the first
performance that you are the composer. I will
privately have the report circulated that I was the
artist who wrote the music. When it comes to the
knowledge of the gentlemen of the chapel for whom
they are taking so much pains, they certainly will
do their utmost to please. So, secrecy and silence.
I will make the necessary explanation to the Elector,
and after the first, and as I hope successful, performance
of the ballet, I will let all the world know
who the real composer is. Are you satisfied with
this arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely grateful to you for it, Herr
Count,&rdquo; replied Beethoven. &ldquo;You have rightly
remarked that many of my associates are maliciously
disposed toward me, and caution therefore will do
no harm. On my part, I accept all your arrangements
with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am convinced we may hope for the best
results,&rdquo; replied the Count.</p>
<p>Everything turned out as Count Waldstein had
expected. The report that he had composed the
music of a Ritter ballet in honor of the Elector was
circulated all over the city, and particularly among
the artists and musicians. Hence when the first rehearsal
of the ballet took place the chapel orchestra
played excellently and correctly. After the rehearsal
the members were of the unanimous opinion that
the music was thoroughly graceful, charming, and
masterly. All were loud in their praises, and many
a one cast a malicious side glance at Beethoven, as
much as to say, &ldquo;Now you see what certain people
can learn from a mere amateur.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Rehearsals were repeated several times, and then
followed the performance of the ballet in the presence
of the Elector and all his court. Everything
passed off well, and the music in particular received
enthusiastic applause. Count Waldstein smilingly
accepted the compliments which were tendered him
on all sides, but no one concerned himself about
Beethoven. He was not in the least troubled on
that score, but smiled to himself at the fawning of
his associates, who bowed low to the Count and extolled
to heaven the music of the ballet. &ldquo;They
will be astonished sometime, when they hear that the
music is mine,&rdquo; he said to himself, rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>When it was announced a few days afterwards
that Beethoven was the composer of the much-praised
ballet, his associates were not only astonished,
but many of them openly acknowledged they had
been deceived in taking him for a fool. Of course
this was said only behind his back, but he heard of
it, and discovered that one of the electoral singers,
named Heller, had been particularly busy in attacking
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Some days later Beethoven went, either accidentally
or purposely, to a popular wine-shop where
there were a number of his chapel associates, among
them the aforesaid singer, Heller. After a hasty
greeting Beethoven seated himself at a side table
and overheard them making sport of him. Heller,
in particular, gave the young composer many palpable
side-thrusts, and boasted that there were
plenty of musicians who could compose better
things than a certain conceited young person ever
dreamed of.</p>
<p>Beethoven listened calmly for a little while without
taking personal notice of the abuse or the
boasting. Suddenly, however, he arose, went to
the table where his colleagues were sitting, and
looked the singer Heller sharply in the eye. &ldquo;Tell
me,&rdquo; he said quietly but firmly, &ldquo;do you not perform
&lsquo;The Lamentations of the Prophet Jeremiah&rsquo;
in church in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Heller. &ldquo;Why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, perhaps I can make a wager with
you,&rdquo; said Beethoven. &ldquo;I will play the accompaniment
on the piano, and will bet that I will
break your time, or, as they say, &lsquo;put you out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I take the bet. What shall it be?&rdquo; cried
Heller with malicious glee; for he believed himself
so sure of winning that he already regarded his
opponent as a loser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A keg of wine, which we can empty together after
church here in the wine-shop,&rdquo; replied Beethoven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is agreed. I take the bet,&rdquo; said Heller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s agreed,&rdquo; said all the other musicians, with
a malicious look at Beethoven; for not one of them
believed that he could &ldquo;put out&rdquo; the most correct
singer of them all. But Beethoven finished his
glass of wine, smiling to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lamentations of the Prophet Jeremiah&rdquo;
are little sentences of four or six lines each, and in
performance are chanted like the old chorals in a
definite rhythm. The tune consists of four successive
tones, several words and sometimes whole sentences
being sung upon the third, and coming to a
rest which the accompanist fills in with a free harmonic
passage. Thereupon the singer returns to
the ground tone,&mdash;not a difficult accomplishment
for a clever musician, if the accompanist does not
&ldquo;put him out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>On the following morning, confident of winning,
Heller began his song. Beethoven accompanied
him at first in the old and customary manner. All
at once, however, he modulated so freely and independently,
while he firmly held the first tone in the
treble, that Heller could not find his way back to it,
and, in fact, was completely &ldquo;put out&rdquo; by the
&ldquo;conceited young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He played incorrectly,&rdquo; said Heller, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, he played correctly and in a
masterly way,&rdquo; retorted Ries, &ldquo;but all the same in
a way that is too much for you. Everything was
done fairly and honestly, as all here will concede.
So keep quiet. You have lost your bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so, then. I will pay for the miserable
keg of wine,&rdquo; roared Heller, &ldquo;but I will also make
complaint to our most gracious Elector about an
accompaniment out of which the devil himself could
not find his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Complain all you will; you will make nothing
by it,&rdquo; said Lucchesi.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> &ldquo;As chapelmaster Ries has
already declared, we not only must, but will, testify
that everything was done fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That does not signify,&rdquo; replied Heller, still in
bad humor. &ldquo;I will yet disgrace him. Such an
accompaniment as his is not proper in church at
least.&rdquo; Seizing his hat, he ran out, and disappeared
before any one could stop him.</p>
<p>Beethoven, entirely unconcerned, let him go.
Neither he nor the others believed that Heller was
in earnest with his threats or that he would really
complain to the Elector against his enemy. But
when the entire party after the service returned to
the wine-shop, where they expected to find Heller,
there was no trace of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is of no consequence,&rdquo; said Beethoven,
good-humoredly. &ldquo;We will drink the keg
of wine regardless of him. I will pay for it out of
my own pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mine host was ordered to furnish some excellent
wine, the glasses clinked, and they gave themselves
up to unrestrained conviviality. Beethoven, delighted
over the defeat of his obstinate and bitter
enemy, overflowed with hilarity, when suddenly
a lackey in the electoral livery appeared in their
midst and loudly asked whether the court organist,
Ludwig van Beethoven, was present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Deep silence followed the question, and consternation
was manifest on every countenance. Had
Heller in his wrath really carried out his threat
after all? Beethoven, who was the one most closely
concerned, understood at once and sprang up.
&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What does His Highness,
the Elector, wish of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you come at once, just as you are, to the
castle,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The Elector wishes to
speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will obey at once,&rdquo; replied Beethoven, as he
took his hat. &ldquo;Do not be disturbed, friends. Perhaps
I shall return soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he had succeeded tolerably well in concealing
his apprehensions while with his companions,
he was not altogether easy in his mind on his way
to the castle. To be sure, he knew from Count
Waldstein&rsquo;s description of the Elector that he was
a very kind and merciful man, but notwithstanding
this he neither knew nor could imagine how he
might criticise that pleasant little artistic performance
in the church. Therefore he prepared himself
to receive an appropriately long and sound rebuke.
He determined to accept it, humbly and patiently,
and at last with tolerable composure entered the
apartment of the Elector.</p>
<p>That high personage was sitting with his back to
Beethoven, writing at his desk. He did not turn
around when Beethoven entered, and apparently did
not hear the servant&rsquo;s announcement. Five minutes,
which seemed an eternity to Beethoven, passed in
utter silence. At last the Elector suddenly threw
down his pen and quickly turned round. &ldquo;Ah!
there you are, dear Beethoven,&rdquo; he said in a by no
means unfriendly manner. &ldquo;Come a little nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="720" />
<p class="caption"><i>Beethoven approached within a couple of steps of the Elector, the latter scrutinizing him with a sharp glance</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Beethoven approached within a couple of steps
of the Elector and bowed low, the latter scrutinizing
him with a sharp glance, which the delinquent stood
bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Beethoven,&rdquo; began the Elector, &ldquo;I
have sent for you that I may thank you for the
beautiful music which you composed for our Count
Waldstein&rsquo;s Ritter ballet. Accept for your services
your appointment as my chamber musician, and
this slight compensation of one hundred ducats.&rdquo;
With these words he took a little roll of gold pieces
and a signed document from his desk and gave
them to Beethoven, whose beaming countenance
could not conceal his joyous surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious master, this is too much, really too
much,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take them, take them,&rdquo; insisted the Elector.
&ldquo;I am well satisfied with you. Count Waldstein
has told me many nice things about you, and I
myself have noticed in the court concerts that God
has bestowed upon you a beautiful and important
talent. It is my duty to promote this,&mdash;and
besides, do you suppose that I will allow you to
give me your compositions? So take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling hands Beethoven took the roll
and the document, and, in his extreme confusion,
stammered out a few disconnected words of gratitude.
The Elector interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;and here his
face assumed a stern expression&mdash;&ldquo;now that we
have finished up this piece of business, a word about
a more serious matter. Heller has been to me, and
complained of you. Before I make my decision I
would like to hear from you what you have really
been doing to Heller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flush of joy in Beethoven&rsquo;s face disappeared,
and gave place to the pallor of fear. He courageously
composed himself, however, and frankly told,
without reserve and with exact truth, the circumstances
of the hostile encounter with Heller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, and find that you are not as guilty
as I feared,&rdquo; said the Elector, resuming a kindly tone.
&ldquo;But, notwithstanding this, are you not aware that
you have made a bad mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I realize it now, gracious master,&rdquo; replied
Beethoven. &ldquo;The church should not have been
the scene of our quarrel. In my passion I did not
think of that. I deserve punishment, and will submit
to it humbly and repentantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the Elector, smiling, &ldquo;he who
recognizes and regrets his faults has already half
atoned for them. I will not be too severe in my
sentence, but I ought not to let your fault go unpunished.
The venerable Abbot of Heisterbach
told me some time ago you had an unsurpassed
talent for organ playing. This gives me the opportunity
to announce your punishment. You are to
be banished from my court for a year, with the
special order that you spend that year in Vienna,
where all distinguished organists ought to go that
they may profit by the knowledge they can gain
there. So you are banished for a year to Vienna.
This is your punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven could hardly believe he heard aright.
&ldquo;But, Your Highness,&rdquo; he exclaimed, his eyes glistening
brightly, &ldquo;this is not a punishment; it is a
reward&mdash;the fulfilment of my dearest wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>The Elector could not repress a slight smile at
the open-hearted simplicity of the young man, but
he quickly assumed a more serious manner and said
earnestly: &ldquo;Any other one would have considered
banishment from my court a very severe punishment,
and I regard it so also, and expected that
you would. It is not complimentary to me that you
should regard removal from my vicinity as a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens! I did not mean it that way,&rdquo;
said Beethoven, seriously alarmed. &ldquo;I intended to
say I had always wished to go to Vienna sometime,
because one can learn the most in music there.
Pardon me, my gracious master. My whole heart
is filled with gratitude to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, quiet yourself,&rdquo; replied the Elector,
and the kindly smile returned to his face. &ldquo;I
think you understand that you are still in favor, but
your punishment must make expiation, and it must
also be considered as punishment. Keep this in
mind. In future I recommend a simple accompaniment
for the church music. As to the other matter,
if you should need any money for the journey, or
anything else, apply to Count Waldstein. He
knows my intentions in relation to you. Adieu,
dear Beethoven, and employ your time usefully in
Vienna, so that it may compensate for your absence
from my court. Adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>A gracious inclination of the head by the Elector,
a low bow by Beethoven, and the audience was at an
end. Intoxicated with delight Beethoven staggered
rather than walked down the steps, and in a corridor
of the castle happened upon Count Waldstein, whom
he would have rushed by without recognizing if the
Count himself had not stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here, my dear fellow, are you again all
fire and flame?&rdquo; he said to him. &ldquo;Has anything
special happened to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know everything already, Herr Count,
for it is you I have to thank for your kind intercession,&rdquo;
replied Beethoven, cordially. &ldquo;Chamber
musician! A hundred ducats! A journey to
Vienna! My head swims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose because of your sorrow over
the unkindness of the Elector, who has punished you
for your petulancy,&rdquo; said the Count, with his peculiar
smile. &ldquo;As a punishment you have been consigned
to banishment from your colleagues. Keep this in
mind. The Elector so wills it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but for my advantage, Herr Count,&rdquo; said
Beethoven, joyfully. &ldquo;But, God knows, it is a
merciful punishment, for which one should be a
thousand times thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>And away he flew to the beloved mother to make
his sorrowful complaint of the severity of the hard,
cruel, merciful Elector.</p>
<p>Tears flowed. It was but natural. But the tears
were certainly not altogether those of sorrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c5"><i>In Vienna</i></h2>
<p>The most distinguished and refined society
of that period was accustomed to
assemble at the house of Prince Lichnowski,<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
and the best music was often
performed there by the most eminent artists. Both
the Prince and his amiable wife had received a thorough
musical education, and loved and promoted
music of the highest kind.</p>
<p>Beethoven brought a most cordial letter of introduction
from Count Waldstein to the Prince, and
consequently received an immediate invitation to a
musical evening at the Lichnowski palace, which he
of course accepted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Upon entering the splendid apartments of the
Prince, he found a brilliant company assembled.
The contrast with his simple, ordinary dress made
him feel a little uneasy, and he would have quietly
slipped away had not Prince Lichnowski fortunately
prevented his attempt to escape, just in time. Beethoven&rsquo;s
name had hardly been announced to him by
a servant before he hastened to receive him, greeted
him in the most cordial manner, bade him welcome,
and shook hands with him warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am exceedingly delighted to see you at my
house,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My friend, Count Waldstein,
has written many nice and kindly things about you,
and His Electoral Highness, the Archbishop, has
added with his own hand the strongest and most
hearty words of recommendation. I hope you will
feel perfectly at home with us very soon. I beg
you to come with me, that I may present you to the
Princess, who will be no less pleased than myself to
make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After such a cordial reception Beethoven quickly
regained his composure, and walked through the
hall at the Prince&rsquo;s side with uplifted head and
without permitting the glitter and finery of the
other guests to disturb him. Many eyes followed
with astonishment the strange figure which, notwithstanding
its entire lack of physical attractiveness,
suggested the bearing of the lion, and
notwithstanding its youthfulness concealed something
great and distinguished under its insignificant
exterior.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The Princess Lichnowski received the young
man with an expression of gracious satisfaction, which
was very agreeable to Beethoven. &ldquo;It is nice that
you are here,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I hope we shall be good
friends, and then we shall have some good music
together. Dear Mozart&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>&mdash;she turned quickly to
a simply but nicely dressed gentleman who stood
near by&mdash;&ldquo;please come here a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mozart smilingly obeyed the summons and bowed
low before the Princess, who held out her hand
familiarly to him, and said: &ldquo;No such ceremony
between us, sir. Here, look at this young man.
This is Herr Ludwig van Beethoven of Bonn, the
electoral chamber musician and court organist&mdash;and
this, my dear Beethoven, is our world-renowned
master, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the brightest
sun in our musical firmament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mozart greeted the young man, of whom he
perhaps had not yet heard, in a friendly but at
the same time somewhat cool manner. Beethoven,
on the other hand, who enthusiastically admired
Mozart&rsquo;s compositions, could not conceal his delight
that an opportunity was offered him to make the
acquaintance of the great master, and expressed his
feelings in the most emphatic manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be a little more quiet, young man,&rdquo; interposed
Mozart, smiling at Beethoven&rsquo;s excessive
adoration. &ldquo;I can readily believe you like some of
my compositions, and that pleases me. But we
will not make too much noise about them. I see
that you know me, but I do not yet know your
ability as a musician. Therefore may I ask that
sometime you will give us something of your best
on the piano? I shall be delighted if I can return
your compliments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven needed no second request. He felt
inspired by the presence of the high priest in the
temple of art, whose wonderful melodies had so
charmed him, and he replied eagerly and quickly:
&ldquo;Where is the piano? If you will listen to me,
Herr Mozart, I will play at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; said Mozart. &ldquo;There is a
piano in the next room. Let us go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; said the Princess, as she clapped her
hands. &ldquo;We shall hear something beautiful now.
Let us go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Beethoven, his heart swelling with pride and eager
to show himself to the master of music in the most
advantageous light, threw himself into his work with
impetuous vigor, and played continuously for a full
quarter of an hour whatever the occasion and his
own genius suggested. Those present listened intently,
and when Beethoven brought his performance
to a close with some splendid chords, a storm of applause
followed. Prince and Princess Lichnowski
openly expressed their astonishment at Beethoven&rsquo;s
artistic skill, and all the others praised him.
Mozart alone remained calm and unexcited, and
contented himself with saying a few coolly polite
words of praise.</p>
<p>Beethoven blushed and turned pale alternately.
He had expected a warmer recognition on the part
of the renowned master, and such cool civility chilled
the enthusiasm and inspiration in his breast like an
icy breath. With a bitter smile he bowed his proud
head and covered his heated brow with his hand.
A moment before, he thought he had accomplished
something excellent. Had his feelings deceived
him? Had he completely overestimated his talent?
That was a terrible thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Silence reigned in the room. The guests also
were disturbed by Mozart&rsquo;s reserved manner,&mdash;the
same Mozart who was always so willing to praise
and quick to appreciate, when there was occasion
for praise and appreciation, and who now showed
not a trace of his customary enthusiasm after such a
specially masterly performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You judge the young man too severely, dear
Mozart,&rdquo; whispered Prince Lichnowski to him.
&ldquo;His playing has really electrified me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that performance is of no great consequence,&rdquo;
replied Mozart, with a shrug of the shoulder.
&ldquo;It is only a prepared show-piece which the
young man has given us; I do not allow myself to
be excited by such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said in a low voice, but Beethoven heard
it. The cloud disappeared from his brow. He
raised his head, shook his mane, and with flashing
eyes said to Mozart:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, that is not a show-piece learned by heart
that I played, but a free fantasie. In proof of this
I ask you to give me a theme for another free fantasie,
and then I will show you what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! Oho! don&rsquo;t get too excited, young man,&rdquo;
replied Mozart. &ldquo;You can have a theme&mdash;develop
this one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Mozart leaned over Beethoven&rsquo;s shoulder, played
the theme, and then stepped back a little. Beethoven
instantly grasped the theme. He always played
best when aroused, and at this instant he was still
excited by the presence of the honored master. He
developed the theme with such skill and brilliancy
of technique that he carried his audience away with
wonder at his inspired performance.</p>
<p>All indifference and coolness disappeared from
Mozart&rsquo;s manner. With the young musician&rsquo;s first
passages and accords, deep interest was apparent on
his countenance, and when Beethoven finished his
fantasie and arose from the piano, Mozart went up
to him, embraced him, and said in a tone of voice
all could hear, &ldquo;This young man, some day or
other, will make a noise in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it was all joy and exultation. Beethoven
was visibly affected, and trembled, while flashes of
triumph shot from his piercing eyes. The princely
couple and the guests overwhelmed him with congratulations.</p>
<p>After that evening Beethoven was regarded in
Vienna as destined to musical greatness, and he
found friends and well-wishers everywhere. Prince
Lichnowski was completely devoted to him. He
gave him a room in his palace, and a standing invitation
to his table as a guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Beethoven thoroughly appreciated these friendly
attentions, but he was not on that account any the
less obstinate and self-willed. Proud of his genius,
which the great Mozart had so clearly recognized,
he did not display a fawning, servile manner. He
seemed rather like one who was on guard against
favors, than as one who was receiving them.</p>
<p>Prince Lichnowski, an extremely amiable man,
and one who was well acquainted with the world, let
Beethoven go his own way. He clearly recognized
the great genius of his young friend, and did not
trouble himself about the oddities, and at times
rude ways, in his behavior. The Princess did the
same. She valued and admired the inner worth
of the young artist, and did not concern herself
about his rough exterior.</p>
<p>The first visit of Beethoven to Vienna was not a
long one. His leave of absence, or, if you prefer,
his term of banishment from the electoral court at
Bonn, approached its end, and he must return home.
His devoted friends, Prince and Princess Lichnowski
chief among them, let him go reluctantly, and cordially
and urgently invited him to return soon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Always consider my house as your residence,
dear Beethoven,&rdquo; said Prince Lichnowski, as he embraced
him at his departure. &ldquo;Whether I may be
in Vienna or not, you will always find a room ready
for you here.&rdquo; The Princess manifested the same
kind feeling.</p>
<p>Beethoven was deeply affected by his separation
from these noble and devoted friends, and with
heart-felt emotion expressed his gratitude for all
the favors he had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come again,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Be it sooner or
later, depend upon it, I shall come. Vienna has
become very dear to me. Such friends as I have
found here are treasures for a lifetime. One must
find such friends to appreciate the joyousness of
living.&rdquo; So he departed; but he forgot neither his
promises nor his affectionate friends and admirers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>In the narrow limits of Bonn the young eagle,
Beethoven, could not spread his wings for his highest
flight. He longed to be back again in the
Kaiser city. There were the great masters of the
art, Gluck, Haydn,<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> and Mozart, whose music was
admired by all cultured persons; and there, music
was considered the highest of all the arts and was
most honored. Beethoven needed such a soil to
bring his mighty genius to its highest development,
and therefore his thoughts repeatedly turned toward
Vienna, and he longed for nothing so ardently as to
go back there. This was not because he loved and
esteemed his old friends in Bonn less than his new
Vienna friends. He clung to them with all his
earlier attachment; but his art urged him on to the
highest and holiest things of life, and it was only
in Vienna that he could find at that time the soil
fitted to bring his art to its complete blossoming.</p>
<p>The Elector, in whose good graces Beethoven
still remained, heard of the ardent wishes of the
young man from Count Waldstein, but for a long
time he did nothing to promote them. A fortunate
dispensation brought the renowned Haydn
to Bonn in July, 1792,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> and Beethoven did not lose
the opportunity to renew the acquaintance which
he had made during his first visit to Vienna.</p>
<p>Haydn manifested delight at seeing the young
artist again, and expressed his astonishment that he
had not yet gone back to Vienna, where he would
be received with the greatest possible pleasure and
honors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault that I was not there long
ago,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The Elector wishes me to
remain here, and I am so greatly indebted to him
that it is impossible for me to oppose his desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truly an unanswerable argument,&rdquo; said
Haydn. &ldquo;For all that, keep up good courage.
Everything will come out right yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it did, and more quickly than Beethoven
had dared to hope. The good Haydn
eloquently appealed to the Elector to gratify the
young man&rsquo;s wishes, and Count Waldstein reinforced
him so enthusiastically that the Elector at
last decided to let him go. It was done as a mark
of favor and honor; and delighted with the realization
of his longings, Beethoven returned, in 1792,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
to his loved Vienna, where he was to settle down
for the rest of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>His friends in Vienna received him with open
arms. Prince Lichnowski again arranged a room for
him in his palace, and gave him a seat at his table,
and the Princess treated him as if she had been his
mother. Beethoven accepted all these proffered
favors with gratitude, and such truly intimate relations
soon existed between his patron and himself,
that his peculiarities, and the little improprieties of
which he was often guilty, failed to disturb them
for any length of time. And the young musician
showed himself peculiar, very peculiar, often extremely
so. For instance, he did not come to the
table for a long time. Prince Lichnowski asked
him the reason, and Beethoven curtly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you think it strange that I am not
seated promptly at table at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon?
Must I be at home every day at half-past
three, dress myself, comb my hair, and shave? Not
by any means! I will not endure it. I decided
at the very first it was best to go to a restaurant.
There at least I am under no restraint, and I can
go and eat at any hour I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince let him have his own way. He fully
realized that one must not put bridle and reins on
an artist like Beethoven, but must let him go as he
pleases.</p>
<p>At another time Beethoven took a fancy to have
daily horseback rides, and had hardly intimated his
purpose when Prince Lichnowski generously placed
his entire stable at his disposal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Beethoven, &ldquo;shall I ride a
strange horse? shall I go and obsequiously ask the
stable-master every time I wish to ride whether it is
agreeable to him to saddle a horse for me? I will
do nothing of the kind; I will buy my own horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did so. He rode a fortnight, and then
seemed entirely to have forgotten that he had a
horse. His whim was over, and his servant had
been doing a profitable business for a long time by
hiring the horse out by the hour.</p>
<p>On still another occasion Beethoven rang his bell
several times one morning, but the servant did not
answer the call. When he came at last, and excused
his neglect by saying that he was ordered to wait
upon the Prince, Beethoven flew into a passion,
took the fellow by the collar, and marched him to
the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This churl has let me wait,&rdquo; he cried in a furious
rage, &ldquo;because you had called him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right, of course,&rdquo; said the Prince,
quietly. &ldquo;Excuse me, dear Beethoven; but you,
Friedrich&rdquo;&mdash;he turned and spoke decidedly to the
servant&mdash;&ldquo;must serve Herr van Beethoven first
when he and I ring for you at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young artist&rsquo;s anger was quickly changed to
shame, and the result was that he procured a servant
of his own that very day, to answer his bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The Prince, as usual, let him do as he pleased,
without paying any attention to his extraordinary
conduct. The good understanding between them
was so little disturbed by it that he gave him an
annuity of six hundred gulden, for the Elector
of Cologne had died in the meantime, and by his
death Beethoven&rsquo;s salary as chamber musician was
cut off.</p>
<p>The young artist&rsquo;s obstinacy was not only displayed
in his countenance, but in his behavior
toward other people. One day he was invited
by an old, wealthy Countess to a reception which
she gave in honor of Prince Louis Ferdinand of
Prussia.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> Beethoven accepted the invitation, for
he highly esteemed the Prince, with whom he was
personally acquainted and of whom he once said:
&ldquo;He plays the piano not like a Prince, but like a
correct, skilful musician.&rdquo; There was music, and
the Prince was friendly and unconstrained in his
intercourse with Beethoven. When they were invited
to supper Beethoven noticed that the haughty
old Countess had arranged to serve the Prince and
certain gentlemen of the higher nobility at a special
table. He arose in a rage, uttered some coarse
expressions about the &ldquo;old fool,&rdquo; put on his hat,
turned his back upon the whole company, and
rushed out like the thundering Jupiter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>All the greater was his delight when the Prince
shortly afterwards compensated him in a most satisfactory
manner. The Prince gave a dinner of state
a few days later, to which, besides Beethoven, the
&ldquo;old fool&rdquo; and the guests of the previous evening
were invited. When they went to the table he
seated Beethoven at his right hand and the old
Countess at his left. Beethoven at last was contented,
and chatted with the Prince during the dinner
in the most agreeable manner.</p>
<p>Beethoven cordially despised what is called etiquette,
and he neither could nor would submit to
the etiquette of the royal court. The Archduke
Rudolph<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
had prevailed upon Beethoven, though
he was very unwilling to do it, to give him lessons on
the piano and in composition. He highly esteemed
the Prince, and on that account faithfully performed
his &ldquo;court service,&rdquo; as he called his lessons to the
Archduke, but submission to instructions from the
court chamberlain, who tried to make him observe
the formalities of etiquette, was far from his intentions.
The chamberlain, however, did not relax his
efforts to instruct him in the regulations, and made
all sorts of signs to him, until at last Beethoven&rsquo;s
patience was completely worn out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>One day, when the chamberlain attempted to
give him a stricter lesson than usual, Beethoven
said in a violent tone: &ldquo;Sir, follow me to the Archduke&rsquo;s
room. I am sick of your everlasting court
chamberlaining and will make an end of it, once for
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chamberlain&rsquo;s face grew a yard long at Beethoven&rsquo;s
order to go to the Archduke, as well as at
his furious tone. He indignantly refused to obey
the sharp command, and Beethoven might perhaps
have been still more vociferous had not the Archduke
himself, who had heard the dispute, opened
the door at that instant and come out of his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is going on here?&rdquo; he asked, astonished
at the wrathful expression on Beethoven&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Archduke, I have the utmost possible
respect for Your Royal Highness, but if I am expected
to obey all the orders and instructions the
court chamberlain is continually pestering me with,
then I must give up coming here any more, for I
don&rsquo;t care about such trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archduke smiled good-naturedly and then
turned with a serious countenance to his chamberlain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must request you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to let Herr van
Beethoven go his own way undisturbed. He is my
teacher, and I regard myself simply as his pupil. I
consider it an honor to be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chamberlain of course accepted this suggestion
in silence, and concealed his chagrin in a low
bow. Beethoven did not again have cause to complain
of him. The chamberlain always kept out
of his way if he could. It was not, however, silly
caprice and obstinacy which made Beethoven so
haughty, but simply the consciousness of his own
greatness, which made him feel himself a peer of all
the great ones of the earth. He would never humble
himself, and he would not be humbled by any one
else; hence at times his justifiable haughtiness of
manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>His outward circumstances improved every year
that he spent in Vienna. In 1792 he had the opportunity
to avail himself of instruction by Haydn
and others, which greatly assisted his artistic progress.
Eight years later he had composed famous
works, and was justly ranked as one of the first
masters in his art, whose star of glory shone not less
brilliantly than those of Mozart and Haydn. He
visited in the highest circles of Vienna society, and
was on friendly terms with the most distinguished
members of the aristocracy of the Austrian capital.
Notwithstanding this, his manner of life was extremely
simple; but he was somewhat peculiar in
his personal habits. A description of one day in his
life will give the reader some idea of his habits.</p>
<p>It is a fine summer day. As the first rays of
the sun stream into his chamber, Beethoven springs
from his bed and rushes to the basin to wash in
cool, fresh water. A bath was an absolute necessity
to him. He pours one pitcherful after another over
his head and hands, and indulges so freely in this
refreshment that he does not notice the wash-basin
is running over. In a few minutes the floor is
inundated, so that he is standing in the water like
a duck. He no longer thinks of the bath. His
head being refreshed, he begins composing, and
while thus engaged continually pours streams of
water over his body, at the same time roaring and
humming to himself&mdash;for he had no voice for
singing&mdash;in a way that would have made a dog
run. His old housekeeper in the outer room
hears the noise and knows from experience what it
all means. She pounds on the door with both fists
and cries: &ldquo;Alas! Herr van Beethoven! Herr
van Beethoven!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he thunders back from
his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will flood all Vienna if you go on in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, Beethoven comes to his
senses. Ashamed of what he has done, he discontinues
his ablutions, quickly throws on his clothes,
and hurries to the desk in his room to create one of
those majestic masterpieces which are destined to
astonish the world. Suddenly he throws down his
pen, and calls: &ldquo;Christine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old housekeeper thrusts her head in the
doorway. &ldquo;What is your pleasure, Herr van
Beethoven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The head vanishes, but shortly after, the whole
figure of the old woman appears. With an air
of solemnity she gives her master a tin box.
Beethoven opens it. It is filled with roasted coffee
beans. Beethoven sniffs their fragrance with delight,
then takes the box and counts the beans, one
by one, with scrupulous accuracy, placing them in a
little pile on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty! hold!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;That is one cup.
Now another.&rdquo; Again he carefully counts sixty
beans, and then gives both piles to the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is enough for two cups. Make it good, or
I will make it myself to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper promises to do her best, and
Beethoven resumes his work, sketching down notes
with wonderful rapidity. When the housekeeper
brings the coffee, he sips it with evident satisfaction,
and then goes to the window to see what the
weather is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! The sun shines! I will take a walk,&rdquo;
he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you never trouble yourself much about the
weather,&rdquo; suggests the old woman. &ldquo;We know that
you run around the city two or three times every day,
whether it blows, rains, freezes, or snows. I believe
you would walk even if you knew that the heavens
above you would fall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Beethoven assents to this. &ldquo;It is healthy.&rdquo;
Then he takes his hat and disappears.</p>
<p>He walks rapidly at first, until he is away from
the bustle of the streets. Then he slackens his
speed, and moves on at a moderate pace, with his
hands behind him, his head thrown back, his eyes
fixed upon the sky. Sometimes he remains motionless,
as if he were unconscious of the world around
him. Upon these occasions his figure rises to its
full height, and his eyes roll and flash brightly, looking
upward or straight forward with the eyeballs
fixed and motionless. A moment of the highest
inspiration has come to him, as it often came, not
alone in the streets, but also in the midst of the
gayest company.</p>
<p>After some minutes of this inward ecstasy, Beethoven
goes on his way, runs around the city a few
times, and then rushes to his house as if his head
were burning. People in the streets stare at him,
wondering why he hurries so, looking neither to the
right nor to the left. In this way he reaches his
house, and enters his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Herr van Beethoven, where
have you left your hat?&rdquo; exclaims his housekeeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Beethoven does not hear her. He rushes to the
piano, plays beautiful melodies for an hour, then
hastens to his desk and writes with the enthusiasm
of one inspired.</p>
<p>When he again lays down his pen his housekeeper
ventures to approach him and repeat her
question&mdash;&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Herr van Beethoven,
where have you left your hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost it, very likely,&rdquo; he replies in a distracted
sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, this is the third time in two months,&rdquo;
she says. &ldquo;You are so absent-minded I really
must fasten your hat upon your head more securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beethoven smiles. &ldquo;I will buy another,&rdquo; he
says, and thus the matter ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ries,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> calls Beethoven after a little. A young
man soon appears, and salutes the master reverently
and tenderly. He is the son of Beethoven&rsquo;s
old friend, chapelmaster Ries of Bonn. The great
master, who usually was extremely reluctant to give
lessons, accepted the young man as a pupil as a
mark of gratitude to his father. Chapelmaster
Ries had been very kind to Beethoven&rsquo;s mother in
the last years of her life, and Beethoven repaid his
kindness by this favor to his son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get to work,&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>Young Ries puts some sheets before the master,
and, now at the piano, now at the desk, they are
speedily absorbed in their work, which is continued
until the housekeeper announces that dinner is
ready. Work is laid aside, and they refresh themselves
with a frugal repast. Beethoven, always simple
in his tastes, drinks a little of the wine grown
on the heights around Buda.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> Fresh, clear spring-water
is his favorite beverage, copious draughts of
which satisfy his needs.</p>
<p>After dinner they go out to enjoy the sylvan
beauty of the Sch&ouml;nbrunn gardens.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> Ries accompanies
the master, but there is little conversation
between them. Beethoven&rsquo;s brain is restlessly at
work. It seems, indeed, that the beauty of the spot
was made only for the purpose of inspiring his
musical ideas. He frequently stops, and jots them
down in a notebook which he always carries, and
in which he preserves them for future use. As
evening approaches they return to the city. On
their arrival at home, the old housekeeper hands
Beethoven two notes, which had been delivered
during his absence. One is from Prince Lichnowski,
simply inviting Beethoven to a musical soir&eacute;e
that evening. The other is from Baron Swieten<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>,
and is characteristic enough. It runs: &ldquo;Dear Beethoven,
if there is nothing to prevent, I should be
glad to see you about nine o&rsquo;clock this evening,
with your nightcap in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this will do for to-day,&rdquo; says Beethoven,
as he throws both the invitations on the table. &ldquo;I
feel at home with the Prince, and I can enjoy myself
at Van Swieten&rsquo;s. But I shall be late to bed.
When Van Swieten tells me to come with my nightcap
it means in plain language, &lsquo;I will not let you
off before midnight.&rsquo; Well, let it be so. He is,
at least, a clever musician and a generous host.
That&rsquo;s all right. But when you are continually
pestered by people who have not the slightest idea
of music, and who only invite you that they may
give their guests some piano-pounding, and then
force you to play until the blood under your fingernails
is on fire, the devil might stand it,&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Prince will not be likely to force you
to play, and Van Swieten just as little,&rdquo; says Ries
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right. I will go, and am glad to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he goes. Between one and two in the
morning he returns in a lively, cheerful mood
which promises pleasant dreams. He is in bed in
five minutes, and five minutes later is sleeping
soundly. And so ends the day&mdash;one day in
Beethoven&rsquo;s life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c6"><i>The End</i></h2>
<p>Although Beethoven lived to see
happy days and happy times in beautiful
Vienna, other days and other times
succeeded them, darkened by a terrible
fate which only a strong and lofty spirit like his
could endure and even overcome.</p>
<p>One fine summer evening Beethoven and his
pupil, Ries, took a pleasant ramble among the beautiful
fields around Vienna. The setting sun flooded
the earth with a sea of gold and purple. Rosy
clouds slowly floated in the sky. High in air the
lark sang its sweet-toned evening song. On a green
hillock sat a shepherd lad, filling the fields and
woods around with the pretty melody of his flute,
which he had fashioned out of elder. Beethoven
and Ries stopped and quietly enjoyed the wonderful
beauty of the dying day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautifully the song of the lark blends
with the shepherd&rsquo;s melody,&rdquo; said Ries. Beethoven
leaned forward and listened. &ldquo;Flute and lark? I
do not hear them,&rdquo; he said, with an expression of
painful suspense on his face.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="733" />
<p class="caption"><i>He had lost his hearing. Ries tried to console and calm him</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is the young shepherd, playing on his
pipe. Do you not see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him,&rdquo; said Beethoven in a pitiful tone.
&ldquo;I see him&mdash;but&mdash;I do not hear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that spot his distressing fate was pronounced.
Beethoven, the musician, who lived only in the
realm of music, had lost his hearing! He could no
longer hear his own beautiful melodies! He would
never hear again the song of the nightingale, or the
orchestra&rsquo;s surging volume of tone.</p>
<p>His misfortune did not come suddenly, like a bolt
out of the clear sky. For years Beethoven had observed
the gradual loss of his hearing, and had
sought medical help for it; but it was during this
walk that the conviction was at last forced upon
him that there was no hope he would ever be
better. Silent, sad, and absorbed in gloomy thought,
he went home. Ries tried to console and calm him,
but for such an artist, with such an affliction, there
could be no consolation, no relief except in humble
submission to the divine will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>An extract from a letter written by him to his old
true friend, Wegeler, in Bonn, dated May 2, 1810,
shows how keenly Beethoven felt this affliction.
He writes: &ldquo;I, however, should have been happy,
perhaps the happiest of men, had not that demon
taken possession of my ears. I have read somewhere
that man should not wilfully part from this
life so long as he can do even one good deed; and
but for this I should ere now have ceased to exist,
and by my own hand too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It could not well be otherwise. His total deafness
could not but exercise a depressing influence
upon Beethoven&rsquo;s disposition, even though it could
not completely dominate his strong character. Usually
frank, cordial, and confiding in his friends,
Beethoven soon became suspicious and distrustful,
irritable and passionate. It was easy for any outsider
to slander his truest friends and set him against
them. On such occasions&mdash;and, alas, they were not
rare&mdash;Beethoven would show no outward sign of his
enmity, utter no reproaches, make no complaints,
and not even call the suspected one to account.
But from that time he would exhibit the utmost
contempt for him. At the same time he would feel
the deepest sorrow, and yet make no explanation
of his conduct. When by some chance the misunderstanding
was cleared up, then Beethoven
sought to make reparation for his injustice in every
possible way. He would offer apologies, and not
rest until reconciled to his injured friend. Then he
was as usual the truest friend, ready to help in every
time of trouble as much as it was in his power to
do so. Even those nearest to him bitterly felt the
pain of his capricious disposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot believe,&rdquo; writes Stephen von Breuning,
one of Beethoven&rsquo;s devoted friends at Bonn,
&ldquo;what an indescribable impression the decay of his
hearing has made upon Beethoven. Think what
the feeling of unhappiness must be in one of such
earnest character, besides his reserve and frequent
distrust of his best friends and his irresolution in
many things. For the most part, when he expresses
his original feeling freely, intercourse with
him is an actual exertion, as one can never feel absolutely
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True indeed; but was not the unfortunate one
the most to be pitied? Let us hear what he says
about it himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Early in 1802 Beethoven was attacked by an
illness so dangerous that for the first time he had
serious doubts whether he should recover. His
friend, the celebrated Doctor Schmidt, checked the
progress of the disease, and when he was fully restored
sent him to Heiligenstadt, a village in the
suburbs of Vienna. There in solitude, his mind
busy with thoughts about death, he wrote the following
document, a kind of will, addressed to his
two brothers:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>For my brothers</i>, <span class="sc">Carl</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Johann Beethoven</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you who consider or assert that I am hostile, obstinate,
or misanthropic, what injustice you do me! You
know not the secret causes of that which makes me appear
so. My heart and my mind have been moved by the tender
feelings of affection from childhood. I have always been
disposed to perform great actions; but consider that for
the last six years I have been afflicted with a hopeless complaint,
aggravated by the unskilful treatment of physicians;
that I have been disappointed from year to year in the hope
of relief, and am at last obliged to submit to the endurance
of an evil the removal of which may take years, if it can
be removed at all. Born with an ardent, lively disposition,
susceptible to the pleasures of society, I was forced at an
early age to renounce them, and pass my life in seclusion.
When I strove to rise above this, oh, how cruelly was I
forced back by the doubly painful experience of my defective
hearing! And yet, how could I say to people, &lsquo;Speak
louder&mdash;shout&mdash;for I am deaf&rsquo;? How could I proclaim
the defect of a sense that I had once in the highest perfection&mdash;a
perfection which few of my colleagues ever surpassed?
I could not! Forgive me then when you see me
refrain from mingling with you, which I would very gladly
do. My misfortune is doubly mortifying to me, for it causes
me to be misunderstood. I am cut off from recreation in
the society of my fellow-creatures, from the pleasures of
conversation, and from the enjoyment of friendship. Well-nigh
alone in the world, I dare not go into society more
than is absolutely necessary. I am obliged to live like an
exile. If I go into company, a painful anxiety seizes me
lest I may be forced to betray my situation. This has
been my condition also during the half year I have spent
in the country. Enjoined by my sensible physician to spare
my hearing as much as possible, I have been almost encouraged
by him in my present disposition, though, carried
away by fondness for society, I have allowed myself to be
drawn into it. But how humiliating it was when one beside
me could hear at a distance a flute that I could not
hear, or a shepherd singing, and I could not distinguish a
sound! Such things brought me to the verge of despair,
and only my art restrained my hand from putting an end to
my life. It seemed impossible for me to quit the world
before I had completed the work which I felt myself set
apart to do. So I endured this wretched life&mdash;a life so
absolutely wretched that the slightest thing is capable of
plunging me from the best into the worst condition. I am
told I must be patient. I have been so. I hope I may be
steadfast in my resolution to persevere until it shall please
the inexorable Fates to cut the thread. I may be better, I
may not. I am prepared for the worst,&mdash;I, who as early
as my twenty-eighth year was forced to become a philosopher.
It is not easy&mdash;it is harder for the artist than
for any other. O God! Thou seest my misery. Thou
knowest that, wretched as I am, I love my fellow-creatures,
and am disposed to do good. O men! when you shall read
this, reflect that you have wronged me; and let the child of
affliction take comfort on finding one like himself, who, in
spite of all the impediments of nature, yet did his utmost to
obtain admittance into the ranks of worthy artists and
worthy men.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>And he has been admitted to those ranks. Notwithstanding
the malignant disease which dispelled
every outward joy of life, Beethoven created those
immortal symphonies, overtures, and sonatas, in
which he proved himself the greatest master of
music and inscribed his name indelibly in the history
of the art. Misfortune could not overcome
him. His splendid genius made him superior to it.
&ldquo;I will clutch fate by the throat,&rdquo; he once wrote to a
friend. &ldquo;It never shall make me bow to it.&rdquo; And
it never did. He wrestled manfully with it, and
subjected it to his powerful will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>That in spite of this he was unsociable to the end,
and often alienated his nearest friends, is easily explained
by the nature of his ailment, which made
conversation extremely difficult. It was due to this
also that Beethoven, always good-hearted and generous
to the suffering, experienced the ingratitude of
his own brothers in various ways. He had suffered
them to come to Vienna, supported them in every
way, and sacrificed a considerable part of his income
in their maintenance for a year. They treated him
with shameful ingratitude, and broke open his chest
and stole all the jewels, snuff-boxes, watches, rings,
and other souvenirs which had been given to Beethoven
by high personages, in recognition of his performances.
Beethoven, that great, noble heart, made
no allusion to the theft; but the knowledge that
those who were nearest to him, who owed their very
existence to him, upon whom he had absolutely
heaped benefactions, had lied to him, cheated him,
and robbed him,&mdash;such knowledge could not contribute
to his happiness, cheerfulness, and affability.</p>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding all this, with all his
misfortune, was Beethoven actually unhappy? Was
he alone in his gloomy solitude? He may have
been at first, but in his later life certainly not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>The happiness of knowing he could create sublime
masterpieces was greater than the unhappiness
of being deaf and misunderstood. He was not solitary,
for the divine genius of art always was his
companion. Beethoven was really happy because
he was greater than his misfortunes. Upon his
heroic brow rests a more splendid ornament than
the crown of any king,&mdash;the laurel-wreath of everlasting
fame, the radiant diadem of immortality.</p>
